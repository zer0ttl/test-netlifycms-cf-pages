Testing to see how obsidian can be used for writing hugo posts.

This is my current setup in obsidian.

* This is *relative path to the file*
  ![my-obsidian-settings](/images/uploads/Pasted%20image%2020230714224133.png)
* This is absolute path in the vault.

![](/static/images/uploads/Pasted%20image%2020230714224323.png)

* Shortest path possible.
